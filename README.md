Pytris
======
**Pytris** is a simple Tetris clone made with Python and Pygame.  The Engine folder contains a lightweight wrapper around Pygame to give me a re-usable platform to build games with Pygame.  I would prefer that folder to be a submodule, but, I can't figure that out yet.

To install and run it, just download this repo and run main.py.  Be sure to have Pygame installed.

```
$ python3 main.py
$ 
```
